# GitHub Codespaces ♥️ Next.js

Welcome to your shiny new Codespace running Next.js! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore Next.js.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with the what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.

## Using three.js for Rendering

The rendering logic in `components/WebGLRenderer.js` has been updated to use three.js for rendering a rotating light grey sphere with lighting. The following changes have been made:

- Replaced WebGL rendering logic with three.js rendering logic.
- Updated the `WebGLRenderer` component to use three.js.
- Added a light grey sphere with lighting.
- Centered the sphere on the viewport.
- Set the background color to black.

## Instructions for Running the Updated Code

To run this application with the updated rendering logic, use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```
